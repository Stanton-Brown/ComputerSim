//This program will print the first 46 fibbonaci numbers.
//It utilizes a stack to store the count, latest fib, and 
//previous fib in that order from top of stack to bottom. 
//Below is an illustration of how the variablse are stored:

//  |     count    |
//  |  latest fib  |
//  | previous fib |

1   //Load first two fib numbers
1
9   //Print first
1
27  //Push to stack
1   //load new line
10
9   //Print new line
2

1   //Load first two fib numbers
1
9   //Print first
1
27  //Push to stack
1   //load new line
10
9   //Print new line
2

1   //Load 46 into AC
46

14  //Load AC into X
26  //DecX to account for the first 2 previous fibs printed
26
15  //Load X back into AC
27  //Push to stack


20  //jump
600

.600
28  //Pop the fib counter

14  //Copy to X
26  //Decrement X 

28  //Pop previous fib number     MUST PUSH AGAIN first!
16  //Copy to Y

28  //Pop old fib number               
11  //Add previous(Y) to old(AC) for new fib          

9   //Print new fib 
1

7   //Store new fib
333

17  //Copy the now old fib to AC
27  //push the now old fib number

1   //load new line
10

9   //Print new line
2

2   //load the new fib 
333

27  //push new fib 

15  //AC = count
27  //push count

22  //loop until we have printed all fibs up to count
600 //jump back to begining of loop

50  //exit

.1000    
30  //incase of timer iterupt just return
